# Smash Tracker
Smash Tracker is a desktop app designed to keep record of win/loss history for players of the game Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Nintendo GameCube. The user interface is made with the Java Swing API and the records are held in an SQLite database.

How to Run Application
------

To run the application, both the SmashRecordTracker.jar executable file and the images folder must be downloaded and in the same directory. Once this is done, simply start the .jar file and the login window will load. 

(Using the app will create a SmashSQL.db file in the directory that your .jar file is found in.)
